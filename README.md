# Crunchyroll_Anime_Tracker
A program that informs if a new episode of a series is available and that lets you track the series you are watching or have watched.

It uses only information from the crunchyroll site. Since I don't know how their update page works, I included all the "seasons" that appear in the anime page. Because of that the code ended up bigger than intended. I'll work more on this project later to make the code cleaner.
